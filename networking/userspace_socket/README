You can run the programs after compiling(just type "make"). Run the simple_tcp_server on machine X1:

#./simple_tcp_server
TCP server waiting for client on port 5566!

NOw run the client on machine X2:

#./simple_tcp_client 192.168.77.1
Server: Shalom!
Client: Are you Jew?

Type "yes" or "no" in X1's terminal:
yes
Server: yes
Client: Actually, the singularitarian has always believed in .....

client is closed!

This is simple enough, right? The above sample was a tcp-based couple. NOw let's try udp ones. Run the server on X1:
#./udp_cmd_server -d
DEBUG MODE has been set...
pid : 22987
File: udp_cmd_server.c, Function: check_instance, Line: 91
Description: can't open dir!
-------------------------------

You might need "-h" or "--help". Run the client on X2:
#./udp_cmd_client 192.168.77.1 "ls"

Now see what happend in X1's terminal:
--------------------------------------
got ls
common.h  select	     simple_tcp_client.c  simple_tcp_server.c  udp_cmd_client.c  udp_cmd_server.c
Makefile  simple_tcp_client  simple_tcp_server	  udp_cmd_client       udp_cmd_server
