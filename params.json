{"name":"SCFE","body":"SCFE is an Open Educational Project.\r\n\r\n** Who will be interested in SCFE?\r\nProgramming beginner, Compute Science/Engineer student or anyone who want to\r\nlearn computer programming. \r\n\r\n** What's in SCFE?\r\nAny \"hello world\" code/docs in all programming area.\r\nYou may learn the sample code for any language you're instered in.\r\nYou may find the simplest operating system or web server or compiler...\r\nYou'll get what you want in your first time study it.\r\n\r\n** So, tell me what is SCFE?\r\nWell, maybe you want to know how to write a Game, and you have no idea, no\r\nbooks, no sample code. You don't know anything about what you're going to \r\nlearn. And SCFE will give you ABC about your target. \r\nNevertheless, it's not only Game. Anything computer programming involved.\r\n\r\n** I know something, can I be a contributor?\r\nYes! Of course! \r\nPlease make sure that your code/docs is easy to learn. The simplest is the best. \r\nBut it doesn't mean everything keep in print \"hello world\" level.\r\n\"hello world\" is a metaphor, which means \"once you see it, you understand it\".","tagline":"sample code for edu","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
