my-SCFE is the record of my hacking journey. I'll share the sample
code which I learned in this repo. 

* What makes it ticks?  

- Every programmer write a lot of sample code while hacking on some
specific techniques. So do I. But the matter is I used to lost a lot
of sample code I wrote before. I don't wanna forget what I learned. I
think this repo will help

* License?

 - Dude, it's just sample code. It should not matter with license. But
   I choose GPLv3 for just in case.
