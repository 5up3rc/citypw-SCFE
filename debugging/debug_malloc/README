Debugging memory leak issues on a production system is just like
playing on fire. This LD_PRELOAD thing can make your job easier. I
thought LD_PRELOAD is a security disaster( especially with set*id
bits) that every audit work I have to take care of it. This crappy
feature also can be the corner stone of user-space rootkit. Anyway,
it'd be great to see one good point about it;-)
