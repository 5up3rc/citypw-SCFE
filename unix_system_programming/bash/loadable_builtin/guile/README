This illustrates how to build a Guile interpreter into bash.  It's not
especially useful; more a proof of concept (it provides none of the
bash internals to the perl interpreter, for example).

If you want to load it, type:
# enable -f ./big big

then you may use big in bash:
# big "(+ 1 1)"
2

# big
