null_test.c is a userspace example in NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE. It
will crash the process while the program try to get the value:

> 0x000000000040050f <+27>:	movl   $0x14,(%rax)

Crash!!! That's so simple. But how a NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE bug
leads to execute the arbitrary code? I think it's impossible in
userspace but it has always been happening in kernelspace. I'll figure
it out later how and why.
