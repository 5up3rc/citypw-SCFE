This is a sample program that can overwrite the EIP register. I wrote
3 programming languages version: C, python and Guile/Scheme. But only
the 1st two are works. I don't know why Guile version have something
wrong with exploit to overwrite the eip register. Fortunately, this is
just a sample code. So only the C code is neccessary.

How to use the code:
#make

C version:
shawn$#./attack
The address of func test(): 0x8048454, func fuck_me(): 0x8048482
AAAAAAAAAABBBBCCCC�� 
being hacked
Segmentation fault

You need to check the fuck_me()'s address. It might be different with
mine. That's only stuff you need to modify in these attack
files(attack.c, attack.py, attack.scm).

python version:
#python attack.py

Guile version:
#guile -l attack.scm

Anyone can help me fix the Guile version? I would really appreciate that.

Happy hacking!
