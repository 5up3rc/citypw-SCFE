ASLR for 32-bit:

    |       |

    |_______ Page directory entry index (10 bits)

PDE and OFFSET don't do the randomization.

memcpy_foritfy sim: __builtin_object_size()[1] would examine the the
size of object, which a pointer points to, only if known at compile
time. This is a fuc*ing trick from GCC mitigation. Well, my hacking
journey was too slow in past 1 year, weren't I? Probably I would speed
up in 2014 if I could;-)

Just ignore the below:

Wait a mins, there's only thing we can do: hacking....until that day come.


Bullshit a lot, again? SOrry about that guys. Seriously, I'm very
curious about these memory corruption mitigation technique. A lot of
terms sound pretty familiar but I totally don't understand what hides
behind the surface. Maybe it's the delicious fruits that only wait for
us, or a final BOSS, which the only BFG can beat with. Can we write
some simulate programs to make us better understanding? Maybe. I will
list some sort of terms we could take it try. I brought the 1st sim
program that does make some sense on PIE technique. Read the fucking
source code, please!

*) AAAS (ASCII Armored Address Space)

AAAS is a very interesting idea. The idea is to load libraries (and more
generally any ET_DYN object) in the 16 first megabytes of the address
space. As a result, all code and data of these shared libraries are located
at addresses beginning with a NULL byte. It naturally breaks the
exploitation of the particular set of overflow bugs in which an improper
use of the NULL byte character leads to the corruption (for example
strcpy() functions and similar situations). Such a protection is
intrinsically not effective against situations where the NULL byte is not
an issue or when the return address used by the attacker does not contain a
NULL byte (like the PLT on Linux/*BSD x86 systems). Such a protection is
used on Fedora distributions.


*) NX <==> ESP (Executable Space Protection)

The idea of this protection mechanism is very old and simple.
Traditionally, overflows are exploited using shellcodes which means the
execution of user supplied 'code' in a 'data' area. Such an unusual
situation is easily mitigated by preventing data sections (stack, heap,
.data, etc.) and more generally (if possible) all writable process memory
from executing. This cannot however prevent the attacker from calling
already loaded code such as libraries or program functions. This led to the
classical return-into-libc family of attacks. Nowadays all PAE or 64 bits
x86 linux kernel are supporting this by default.
 

This mechanism can be implemented by hardware or software
emulation. Take a look: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NX_bit

in gcc's options, NX is enable by default. If you want to turn it off,
use "-z execstack".
shawn@shawn-fortress ~ $ readelf -l a.out | grep GNU_STACK
  GNU_STACK      0x000000 0x0000000000000000 0x0000000000000000 0x000000 0x000000 RW  0x8

*) ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization)

The idea of ASLR is to randomize the loading address of several memory
areas such as the program's stack and heap, or its libraries. As a result
even if the attacker overwrites the metadata and is able to change the
program flow, he doesn't know where the next instructions (shellcode,
library functions) are. The idea is simple and effective. ASLR is enabled
by default on linux kernel since linux 2.6.12.

*) Stack canaries (canaries of the death)

This is a compiler mechanism, in contrast to previously kernel-based
described techniques. When a function is called, the code inserted by the
compiler in its prologue stores a special value (the so-called cookie) on
the stack before the metadata. This value is a kind of defender of
sensitive data. During the epilogue the stack value is compared with the
original one and if they are not the same then a memory corruption must
have occurred. The program is then killed and this situation is reported in
the system logs. Details about technical implementation and little arm race
between protection and bypassing protection in this area will be explained
further.

GCC options:
-fno-stack-protector,  do not add any canary onto any functions

-fstack-protector, only add the canary onto a few functions in compile time 

-fstack-protector-all, add the canary onto all functions, be cautions
 about this one. It'd be triggered the heavily performance hit.

-fstack-protector-strong, add the canary onto those functions, which
 the stack buffers would be used. This is a smart one. But its only
 supported by GCC 4.9.x.

Check the symbols in an elf file: 
#readelf -s ./a.out | grep stack_chk_fail
     3: 0000000000000000     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND __stack_chk_fail@GLIBC_2.4 (3)
    52: 0000000000000000     0 FUNC    GLOBAL DEFAULT  UND __stack_chk_fail@@GLIBC_2


*) RELRO

RELocation Read-Only.

Turn it on: -z norelro 
Turn it off: -z now

Check elf header to find partial-RELRO:
shawn@shawn-fortress ~ $ readelf -l a.out | grep GNU_RELRO
  GNU_RELRO      0x0000000000000e28 0x0000000000600e28 0x0000000000600e28

Check elf's dynamic sections to find fully-RELRO:
shawn@shawn-fortress ~ $ readelf -d a.out | grep BIND_NOW
 0x0000000000000018 (BIND_NOW) 

*) PIE

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position-independent_code

GCC option: -pie, it only work for sec mitigation when kernel enables ASLR.

no PIE:
shawn@shawn-fortress ~ $ readelf -h a.out | grep "Type:[[:space:]]*EXEC"
  Type:                              EXEC (Executable file)

PIE:
shawn@shawn-fortress ~ $ readelf -h a.out | grep "Type:[[:space:]]*DYN"
  Type:                              DYN (Shared object file)
