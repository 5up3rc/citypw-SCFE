Before you dive into the detail source code of GNUTLS, you'd better
compile/install it manually. But you known, hacker is always one of
laziest type of person around the world. We want everything
automatically. We did functional testing at first place, then we want
to tranform it's boring shit to automation testing. Even in security
ield, there are a bunch of guys( not lamer ones;-)) are trying to make
the pentest/exploit shits automatically. I used to be an open source
security QA guy and tried some automation tools( like ctcs) to satisfy
my "lazy" requirement. Then I've starting maintain some security
packages and fixing/backporting CVEs issues for "some" GNU/Linux
distro. I've been doing this type of work for months but haven't
compile the packages I'm maintaining with. What a shame;-)


I wrote a simple script today and it will help if you wanna compile
GNUTLS in manual:

./get_repos.sh 
Usage: [ Compile packages automatically: yes/no]

Type:
./get_repos.sh no  ===> only download the packages without compiliation
./get_repos.sh yes ===> download the packages then compiliation

If you choose "yes", you can check if it's really work:
Open two terminals: T1, T2

T1: Run the anonymous server with TLS
john@sl13:~/gnutls_uses$ ./anonymous_serv 
Server ready. Listening to port '5556'.

- connection from 127.0.0.1, port 59923
- Handshake was completed

- Peer has closed the GnuTLS connection

T2: Run the client
john@sl13:~/gnutls_uses$ ./anonymous_cli 
- Handshake was completed
- Received 18 bytes: GET / HTTP/1.0

That's it! Have fun with it!
