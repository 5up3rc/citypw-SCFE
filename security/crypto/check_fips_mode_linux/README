According to Roman Drahtmueller's documentation[1], there are 3 ways to
switch on/off to FIPS-140-2 compliant mode in GNU/Linux:

1, Append "fips=1" to kernel cmd-line of grub's config file
menu.lst. It works fine!

2, export OPENSSL_FORCE_FIPS_MODE=1

3, Use some libcrypto functions to set the FIPS MODE and get the
current mode info, such as FIPS_mode_set(int onoff)/FIPS_mode(void)

I wrote two simple examples, one is to check if the current OS support
FIPS mode or not, another is to get the current FIPS mode and set the
new one.

shawn@linux-7kz0:~/check_fips_mode_linux> ./check_fips_mode_linux 
FIPS_MODE: 0
shawn@linux-7kz0:~/check_fips_mode_linux> ./get_set_fips_mode 1
Current FIPS mode: 0
After setting, current FIPS mode is: 1

I tested these two programs on SLES 11 SP2. Before you compile these
programs, you need install some packages at first:

The FIPS can't work without hmac package:
zypper in libopenssl0_9_8-hmac libopenssl0_9_8-hmac-32bit

You also need libopenssl's header files:
zypper in libopenssl-devel
