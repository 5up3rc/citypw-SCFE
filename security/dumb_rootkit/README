Shawn the R0ck - Nov 22nd, 2012

It's fucking busy on day job recently. But I still could'nt forget the
most important thing: Night job. Hacking on security stuff is much fun
than other tehcnique field. Endless functional testing did really
fucked my mind. I need a fresh air and take a deep breathe...PM 2.5 is
fucking high in Beijing, shit*Why should I be here? I really want to
go back to hometown if I can work at home. Wait a min, where is my
fucking home? Switchfoot told us that we do not belong here-_-

hmm..I bullshited a lot again...Let's talk about this example
program. It's a simple rootkit for GNU/Linux kernel and it was
implemented via kprobe[1] mechanism, which is provided by kernel
itself. kprobe is very powerfull and it was designed for kernel
debugging. Or, we could use it do our things. You known, as a security
guy, makes your hands dirty in the kernel land is just matter of
time. This rootkit allows use normal users do the root's business.

What the fuck was going on? RTFSC.....

Today is Thanksgiving Day. I'm celebrating this holiday but I'm not a
yankee. I'm a christian but I'm not very religious. I get used to call
myself a "neo-calvinist technological christian". It's quite long,
isn't it? The matter is that name is not important anymore. In the
cyber space( internet?), it doesn't fucking matter who you are or how
rich you are. Even we( hackers?) don't care about your sexy ass. The
idea is the only matter!

Thank God, Phrack is still running...and, never better!

May L0rd's hacking spirit guide us!!!
